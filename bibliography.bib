	abstract="A formal model for automatic error-correction is presented. It considers clusters of errors, using a local context to determine the corrections. The process can be embedded in left-to-right recognizers. The recognizer is used for standard syntax checking. When an error is detected, an error correction mechanism is activated which, by a limited backward then forward move, determines the possible corrections. An important aspect of this process is that it does not slow down the parsing of correct programs.",
